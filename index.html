            <h2>MARRIAGE PROPOSAL MAPPED OUT BY PORTSMOUTH JOGGER'S APP</h2>
            <p>A Portsmouth runner has proposed to his girlfriend by spelling out "Will You Marry Me" using a GPS tracking application. The couple met through a mutual friend on Facebook when they commented on a post and then started chatting.</p>
            <p>Ben Chudley, 28, used a running app to track his progress around the city's streets before posting the route on Facebook. When he posted it on Tuesday evening, his girlfriend Olivia Abdul saw it and accepted his proposal. Mr Chudley, who had also drawn dinosaurs and cartoon characters in the same way, said the idea was "very me".</p>
            <p>He explained he had carefully designed his route using online mapping and had run the
                5.71mile (9km) route. Mr Chudley told his girlfriend he was going out for a run before posting
                the map on Facebook and returning, with flowers and a ring, to hear her response. He admitted
                that posting it publicly "could have been very embarrassing if she had said no."</p>
            <p>Mr Chudley had started a Facebook group of similar 'drawings'. In the past he had attempted
                a seahorse and a dinosaur but said Portsmouth's regular street layout made it easier to form
                letters. He added that making a wrong turn half way through a run can be "heart breaking" as it
                means having to start the tracking again.</p>
            <p>Surprised Olivia, who was given a gold and diamond engagement ring, said: "I was so
                happy.”</p>
            <p>The bride-to-be said the couple had been flooded with well-wishes from friends and family.</p>

                <h2>THE WOMAN WHO IS UNABLE TO FEEL FEAR</h2>
                <p>Mary, a woman from the United States, cannot feel the emotion of fear, because of a very rare genetic condition. She has never been interviewed before, because her doctors say that people could easily take advantage of her if her identity was made public.</p>
                <p>She says that she remembers being scared just once in her life. She was still a young girl and her father was fishing and caught a catfish. She was frightened because she didn’t want it to bite her. In fact, that was the only time she can remember experiencing fear.</p>
                <p>Once, when her sons were small and she was out for a walk, a man called her over. He grabbed her by the shirt, and he held a knife to her throat and told her he was going to cut her. She said, “Go ahead and do it”. The man let her go, and she went home, but she didn’t call the police, as she didn’t see the danger.</p>
                <p>She is also unable to recognise a fearful expression on the face of another person. Still, she has normal intelligence and recognises other emotions such as joy, or anger in the same way as others.</p>
                <p>If she sees a poisonous snake that would make most people really scared, Mary will touch it without any problem. She isn’t afraid in such situations and has no bad memories afterwards.</p>
                <p>‘If you have no fear, many more terrible things will happen to you,’ one of her doctors explained to journalists. ‘However, if you have a lot of fear, fewer bad things will probably happen.’</p>
                <p>So is it better to be fearful or fearless? </p>
